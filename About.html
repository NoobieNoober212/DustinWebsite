        <h3>D.O.</h3>
        <p>A D.O. is an Osteopathic physician. While DO's are fully licensed in diagnosing and treating illnesses and disorders as well as providing care, they also are educated in some special training that allopathic physicians do not receive.When studying at a school that teaches people to be a Osteopathic physician, you’ll learn about Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment, or OMT for short.MD’s do not typically receive this training. OMT uses your own hands to diagnose and treat an illness or injury. Osteopathic Medicine also emphasizes the integration of the entire body's systems, and many of the osteopathic schools place special emphasis on preventive medicine.</p>
